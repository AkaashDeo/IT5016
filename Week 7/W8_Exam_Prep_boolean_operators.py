print(True and True)                  # Evaluates to True because both operands are True
print(True and False)                 # Evaluates to False because one operand is False
print(False and False)                # Evaluates to False because both operands are False

# OR operator examples
print(True or True)                   # Evaluates to True because at least one operand is True
print(True or False)                  # Evaluates to True because one operand is True
print(False or False)                 # Evaluates to False because both operands are False

# NOT operator examples
print(not True)                       # Evaluates to False because the operand is True
print(not False)                      # Evaluates to True because the operand is False

# Equality operator example
print(5 == 5)                         # Evaluates to True because both sides are equal

# Inequality operator example
print(5 != 5)                         # Evaluates to False because both sides are equal

# Less than operator example
print(4 < 5)                          # Evaluates to True because 4 is less than 5

# Less than or equal to operator examples
print(5 <= 5)                         # Evaluates to True because 5 is equal to 5
print(4 <= 5)                         # Evaluates to True because 4 is less than 5

# Greater than or equal to operator example
print(5 >= 5)                         # Evaluates to True because 5 is equal to 5
print(6 >= 5)                         # Evaluates to True because 6 is greater than 5
