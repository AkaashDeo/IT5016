# Addition
1 + 1                                    # Perform addition of 1 and 1
print(1 + 1)                             # Output the result of 1 + 1

# Subtraction
2 - 1                                    # Perform subtraction of 1 from 2
print(2 - 1)                             # Output the result of 2 - 1

# Multiplication
5 * 5                                    # Perform multiplication of 5 by 5
print(5 * 5)                             # Output the result of 5 * 5

# Division
25 / 5                                   # Perform division of 25 by 5
print(25 / 5)                            # Output the result of 25 / 5

# Exponents
5 ** 3                                   # Calculate 5 raised to the power of 3
print(5 ** 3)                            # Output the result of 5 ** 3

# Modulus (remainder after division)
17 % 5                                   # Calculate the remainder of 17 divided by 5
print(17 % 5)                            # Output the result of 17 % 5
