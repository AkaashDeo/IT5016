""" 
This program demonstrates the use of Python's built-in functions: min(), max(), and len().
It showcases how to find the minimum and maximum values from a set of numbers, as well as the length of strings.

"""Min function"""
print(min(5, 78, 15))                              # Find and print the minimum value among the given numbers (5, 78, and 15).

"""Max function"""
print(max(5, 78))                                 # Find and print the maximum value among the given numbers (5 and 78).

"""Length function"""
length = len("123456789")                         # Calculate the length of the string "123456789" and store it in the variable 'length'.
print(length)                                     # Print the length of the first string.

length = len("abcdefghij")                        # Calculate the length of the string "abcdefghij" and store it in the variable 'length'.
print(length)                                     # Print the length of the second string.
