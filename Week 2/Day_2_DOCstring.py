# DOCSTRING EXPLAINATION AND USAGE

"""

A docstring is a special kind of comment in Python that is used to document a module, class, method, or function. 
It is placed right after the definition of a function, class, or module and is enclosed in triple quotes. 
Docstrings serve as a convenient way to describe what the code does, its parameters, and its return values.
